OECD STI Hackaton 2022

This hackathon has the aim of anwering to the following question: 

"Can we charactetise typologies of strategies and/or policies that aim to foster the responsible development of emerging technologies for societal benefit? Do such policies focus on specific technologies and, if so, whcich ones?"

For that, we will use two datasets:

*STI strategies database*

The TIP STI strategies database consists of a text corpus including more than 300 STI policy strategy documents (several million words overall) from across 24 OECD countries that covers the past several years, including both the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the period immediately prior. The documents have been collected in collaboration with national government officials working on STI policies in a range of public administrations and have been pre-processed and machine-translated to English by the OECD.

The dataset includes the following columns:

country: Name of the country that issued the document
year: Year when the document was issued
period: Indicator for whether the document was issued before or during the COVID-19 pandemic
doc_id: Identifier of the document
title: Title of the document
text original: Original text of the document
text translated: Translated text of the document
text clean: Translated and cleaned text of the document (no numbers and punctuation, no stopwords, lemmatization, n-grams)

*STIP Compass policy database*

The STIP Compass policy database includes qualitative data on national STI policies. It is made up of close to 7000 initiatives from 57 countries and the European Union. The database covers all areas of STI policy, including initiatives spread across different ministries and national agencies, with competence over domains as broad as research, innovation, education, industry, environment, labour, finance/budget, among others. Its data is collected from a survey addressed to national government officials working on STI policies in a range of public administrations.
